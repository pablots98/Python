# Agent-Based Model
This project simulates agent-based behavior in a 2D environment using Python. Agents interact with their surroundings according to predefined rules, showcasing basic principles of agent-based modeling.
## Features
- Random Movement: Agents move randomly in a 2D grid.
- Interaction: Agents stop moving when they come within a certain distance of each other.
- Customizable Parameters: Adjust movement rules and interaction distances.
